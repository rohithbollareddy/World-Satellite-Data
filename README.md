Data Vizualizations on World space agencies and Satellites
As the number of operational satellites in orbit grows, so does the demand for an accurate and up-to-date satellite database. Satellites are an essential component of modern technology, and their significance cannot be overstated. The vast amount of information available from the satellite database, on the other hand, could be overwhelming and misleading. To gain insights into the world of satellites in orbit, this project employs data analysis and visualization technologies. The goal of this project is to provide a platform for people to examine and analyze satellite data in the UCS satellite database. This research will also look into the organizations involved, as well as the distribution, use, and orbit of satellites.
